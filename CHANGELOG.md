# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes are documented here. Relayer is alpha software
and this file follows the structure of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
without implying semantic-versioning stability before the first release.

## [Unreleased]

No release tag has been published at the time of writing.

### Added

- A Bubble Tea supervisor for one to eight local interactive agents, with
  paging, viewport navigation, mouse scrolling, prompt focus, and bounded logs.
- PTY sessions with process-group ownership, resize propagation, input routing,
  output retention, and shutdown cleanup.
- Relayer-owned tmux sessions with private launch transport, streamed output,
  native attach/resync, explicit persistence policy, and ownership-verified
  cleanup.
- A product-neutral generic regex adapter with ANSI streaming, carriage-return
  handling, active-prompt filtering, occurrence IDs, snapshot reconciliation,
  and bounded state.
- Strict version 1 YAML for agents, backends, session lifecycle, prompt
  patterns, policies, and audit recording.
- Conservative first-match policy evaluation with allow, ask, deny, dry-run,
  sensitive-event, credential, and risk safeguards.
- A local versioned JSONL audit recorder with metadata and detailed modes,
  bounded redaction, rotation, private Unix storage, lifecycle records, and
  fail-closed delivery behavior.
- Deterministic Bash mock agents and a VHS tape that does not depend on a
  vendor CLI or captured transcript.
- Development build version output through `--version`.

### Changed

- The minimum build toolchain is Go 1.25.8 so release binaries include the
  standard-library security fixes enforced by `govulncheck`.
- `--pane1` and `--pane2` remain available as deprecated direct-command
  overrides; versioned YAML is the primary interface.
- Empty version 1 agent lists retain the historical two-mock quick start.
- Legacy direct pattern lists and `intercept_patterns` wrappers remain readable,
  with conservative defaults and auditing disabled for compatibility.

### Security

- Backend and adapter selection, policy validation, and audit initialization
  happen before agent startup.
- Partial startup and failed session-start audit writes trigger rollback.
- tmux cleanup requires immutable Relayer ownership evidence and never kills
  the tmux server.
- Terminal input, raw output, commands, environment values, prompt matches, and
  raw errors are excluded from the audit model.
- Audit storage rejects unsafe leaf symlinks and non-regular targets and checks
  private Unix ownership and permissions.
